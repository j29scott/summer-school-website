                                                Waterloo. Prior to joining Waterloo in 2012, he was a research
                                                scientist at MIT (2007-2012) and completed his PhD in computer science
                                                from Stanford University in 2007. Vijay's primary area of research is
                                                the theory and practice of automated mathematical reasoning algorithms
                                                aimed at software engineering, formal methods, security, and
                                                mathematics. In this context he has led the development of many SAT/SMT
                                                solvers, most notably, STP, Z3 string, MapleSAT, and MathCheck. He has
                                                also proved several decidability and complexity results in the context
                                                of first-order theories. He has won over 25 awards, honors, and medals
                                                to-date for his research, including an ACM Test of Time Award at CCS

                                                Computer systems are becoming smaller, faster, pervasive, ubiquitous,
                                                mobile, connected, adaptable,
                                                and "smart". We are increasingly becoming dependent on their correct
                                                operation. Yet, developing correct
